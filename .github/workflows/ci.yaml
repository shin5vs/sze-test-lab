    branches: [ "main" ]

defaults:
 run:
  working-directory: ./lab_4_api_tests

jobs:
  # This job is named "test"

    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Sets up a single, specific version of Python
      - name: Set up Python 3.11
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.12'
          cache: 'pip' # Caches dependencies to speed up future runs

      # Step 3: Installs the project dependencies from requirements.txt
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      # Step 4: Runs the pytest command to execute all tests
      - name: Run tests with pytest
        run: |
          pytest -v

                # Step 5: Start Flask server
      - name: 🚀 Start Flask Server in Background
        run: |
          # Use '&' to run the server in the background
          # You may need to adjust the command based on your Flask file/setup (e.g., 'flask run' or 'python app.py')
          FLASK_APP=app.py flask run &
          # Give the server a moment to start up
          sleep 5 
      
      # Step 6: Install Newman
      - name: 📦 Install Newman (Postman CLI)
        run: npm install -g newman
      
      # Step 7: Run Postman tests using Newman
      - name: 🧪 Run Postman Tests with Newman
        run: |
          newman run collection.json \
